IvyTrigger provides polling mechanisms to poll an Ivy file and triggers
a build if an Ivy dependency version has changed.

  

# Features

The plugin makes it possible to monitor the dependencies of an Ivy
descriptor.  
For example, if a dependency has the following revision 'latest.release'
or '2.+' and a new artifact has been deployed in the repository manager
(managed by Ivy), a new build is scheduled.

Note: The plugin uses only persistence in memory. There is no impact on
the Jenkins infrastructure (no new files created).  
This plugin provides a polling typology among the .
